No type of harassment is acceptable, be it sexual, moral, or any other, nor are any situations that constitute disrespect, intimidation or threat in the relationship among co-workers, regardless of their hierarchical position. We illustrate, below, some situations that may constitute harassment and that are not accepted, under no circumstances in our workplace and routine:

* Leaders who disrespect subordinates and make use of tone of voice or vocabulary considered inappropriate to refer to them;

## RESPECT TO INTELLECTUAL AND INDUSTRIAL RIGHTS

Considering the market niche in which Hotmart acts, it is undeniable that the search for a market that is free of acts and actions that violate or may violate intellectual and industrial rights is essential to build a digital business environment that is strong and robust, making it possible for people to create and distribute digital content safely.

### Definitions

#### Workplace

The workplace is made up of the Company’s facilities, places in which Troopers provide their services on behalf of Hotmart and any environment where there are get-togethers, parties or celebrations promoted by the Company.

#### Do you know what harassment is?

Harassment covers a wide range of behaviors of an offensive nature. It is commonly understood as behavior that disturbs or upsets, and it is characteristically repetitive. This repetitive aspect does not, in any way, mean that one instance may not be considered harassment. We once again reinforce that any behavior that is noticed, understood, witnessed or felt as harassment should be reported immediately to the Talents Team, your leader, or a member of the **All for One**.
In the legal sense, harassment is behavior that appears to be disturbing or threatening.

#### Sexual Harassment

This is a kind of harassment that can happen anywhere but is most common in the workplace and schools. It involves unwanted and unwelcome words, deeds, actions, gestures, symbols, or behaviours of a sexual nature that make the target feel uncomfortable. It is defined as any kind of approach, be it verbal, virtual, or physical, that aims to take advantage sexually from the victim, by using the hierarchy in the workplace or not.

#### Moral Harassment

Moral harassment is the exposition of someone to humiliating and embarrassing situations. It is the repeated and prolonged exposure of workers to embarrassing and humiliating situations during the workday and in the performance of their jobs. Very often this concerns the relations in the chain of command and can mean authoritarian or negative behavior on behalf of superiors without ethical conduct over a long period of time. It can involve one or several superiors and how they conduct themselves with someone who reports to them resulting in the destabilization of the victims and their relationships to their work environment and organizations.

#### Do you know what discrimination is?

Discrimination is the treatment or consideration of, or making a distinction in favor of or against, a person or thing based on the group, class, or category to which the person or thing is perceived to belong rather than on individual attributes. It may occur in different contexts, being the social the most common, through cultural, ethnic, political, religious, sexual or age discrimination, but not limited to these, that may lead to social exclusion.

The International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (ICERD), in 1966, defined discrimination as

> Any distinction, exclusion, restriction or preference based on race, colour, descent, or national or ethnic origin which has the purpose or effect of nullifying or impairing the recognition, enjoyment or exercise, on an equal footing, of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the political, economic, social, cultural or any other field of public life.
