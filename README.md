# Code of Conduct

## Why should we have a Code of Conduct?

Culture is the most valuable asset at Hotmart. It is our Culture that is the compass for the people in our teams, and guides the manner in which the routine of the Company is conducted. Our Culture is so decisive in all of our decisions, that it represents a determinant step in the promotion, dismissal and selection processes, in order for everyone who joins the team shares the same moral standard of the Company and the people of which it is composed. Thus, and from the assumption that the Company is made up of people with similar values, why should we have a Code of Conduct?

## The answer to this question is simple.

Even though the Culture of the Company guides, assertively, the disposition of the people in the team, it is natural, and extremely likely, that situations will arise in which making decisions may seem difficult and challenging.

When in doubt, therefore, it is always better to have a document to resort to, and direct attitudes based on the conduct established by the Company. After all, we put autonomy first and our goal is to make it possible for all to act, in different situations, without the need to consult with their leaders.

We also expect this document to guide the behavior, not only of our employees, but also of our partners, clients, suppliers, and all those who, in any fashion, do business or maintain a relationship with our Company and with our services.

## How do we apply this Code of Conduct?

On the very first day of work at Hotmart, the new employee receives a printed copy of our Culture Deck and is oriented, by the colleague assigned to be his or her “godmother” or “godfather”, to read the content in its entirety. Thus, the person has a broader view of how the Company works, how the atmosphere of the work environment is, and how Hotmart expects him or her to act to be a part of the smooth functioning of the organization.

Basically, the Culture Deck is the main behavioral handbook of the Company, and plays the role of a guide in a variety of situations. However, some specific pieces of information are not covered in it, although they require attention. That’s why the Code of Conduct will orient in actions and decisions that cannot be taken or made based purely on the information contained on the Deck, and that require a more singular and detailed analysis.

## What does Hotmart expect from you?

If you have joined the team, it means that your compatibility with the Company has been proven, and it is clear that we place an enormous amount of trust in you and your attitudes. We hope that, with the help of this Code of Conduct, you feel more secure when making important decisions, without fearing you will go against the moral directives of the Company, and, most importantly, against your own. What we aim at the most is that this Code is a reflection of how you conduct yourself in your personal life, and therefore we will be sure we think and act similarly, and that we can contribute to one another.

## Responsible Committee: All for One

Our Company is a small sample of the society we desire, the way people organize themselves and defend their own interests, and therefore the first step in being coherent to the world and with what it needs is to promote, inside the organization, actions that lead to positive impacts on the employee as a professional, and, most importantly, as a human being.

It is from this mindset that All for One was created, a committee formed by volunteers willing to discuss and implement internal and external actions, on cultural, social and economic contexts, with the objective of making a positive impact on Hotmart employees and the community as a whole.

The goal of All for One is to contribute so that the Company and society itself walk towards freedom, solidarity, justice, free of discrimination and prejudice, and full of diversity, respect and tolerance. The purpose of All for One is to ensure that the Hotmart Code of Conduct is always complied with, and that the necessary changes and adaptations are made and applied according to demands that may arise.

## What happens in case of violations to the Code?

We believe in human beings, and we especially believe in their abilities to learn from their own mistakes. Therefore, it is safe to say that everyone that, for any reason, has deviated from the behavior the Company expects them to follow, and against what is stated in the Culture Deck, will have ample support and opportunities to rethink and revert their actions. However, the content presented in the Code of Conduct covers ethical and non-negotiable issues, and therefore the non-compliance to it signifies a considerable disparity between Company and employee.

If a Trooper sees a violation to the Code, or if he or she feels disrespected, we encourage that a conversation is engaged to solve the problem that has been identified. If the Trooper does not feel comfortable or is unable to find an adequate atmosphere to approach the situation, he or she should talk to the leader or the Talents Team. More serious matters, such as crimes, harassment, abuse or violence, must be notified immediately.

It is important to highlight that every single case will be analyzed by the All for One committee, alongside the Talents Team, and the measures to be taken will be set according to the gravity of each situation. The cases will be dealt with in a secure fashion, as carefully as possible, without retaliations. If any of the people involved in the case is a member of the All for One or of the Talents Team, they will not be included in the analysis of the case, nor in the decision-making process.

The measures taken in case of violations to the Code of Conduct are:

* Oral or written notice
* Termination without cause
* Termination for cause

In taking disciplinary actions, the nature and gravity of the violation will be taken into consideration, and also the consequences from the acts, to other individuals and to the Company as a whole.
