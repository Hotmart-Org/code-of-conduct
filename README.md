### Why should we have a Code of Conduct?

Culture is the most valuable asset at Hotmart. It is our Culture that is the compass for the people in our teams, and guides the manner in which the routine of the Company is conducted. Our Culture is so decisive in all of our decisions, that it represents a determinant step in the promotion, dismissal and selection processes, in order for everyone who joins the team shares the same moral standard of the Company and the people of which it is composed. Thus, and from the assumption that the Company is made up of people with similar values, why should we have a Code of Conduct?

The answer to this question is simple.

Even though the Culture of the Company guides, assertively, the disposition of the people in the team, it is natural, and extremely likely, that situations will arise in which making decisions may seem difficult and challenging.

When in doubt, therefore, it is always better to have a document to resort to, and direct attitudes based on the conduct established by the Company. After all, we put autonomy first and our goal is to make it possible for all to act, in different situations, without the need to consult with their leaders.

We also expect this document to guide the behavior, not only of our employees, but also of our partners, clients, suppliers, and all those who, in any fashion, do business or maintain a relationship with our Company and with our services.
